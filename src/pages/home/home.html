    <strong id="s1">This app has 4 different tabs to it:<br /></strong>
    The first one is the 'home' tab, which is what this is. I hope that the cute stuff I put on here makes you happy. :) The second tab is 
    a surpise and you have to fool around with it. Im not telling you anything hehe. Theres tons of secret, magical stuff in there. Somewhere...
    The third and fourth tabs are really similar. They are separate so that you can make a decision based on the category of the
    choice, rather than it telling you to get food even if you're not hungry. You can add items in the upper right corner, and then edit
    or delete them by sliding to the left accross the added item. If you push the 'pick...' button, it will randomly choose 
    one of the items. Those two tabs took me a really long time to make, but they work really well. Hopefully with no errors. 
    The fifth one is boring, and just has information about the app. There are a couple easter eggs hidden in the app, but you 
    have to put some effort into finding those ;).

    Sorry this app took me so long to make. But I wanted it to be perfect for you, mon amour. 
    I'm not sure how useful this will be, or how well it will work.
    This is my first time making an app and its really hard for IOS so I hope I can get that to work. 
    Worst case, it'll work on my phone I hope.

    Anyways, you've done so much for me, it amazes me. Its hard for me to express in words how much I care about you and how much you've
    done for me as a person. So I made an app. TADAHH. I hope it works :/. Well this app isn't perfect, and neither am I. I say lots of dumb stuff
    and do some really dumb stuff. But I put a lot of effort into this, trying to make it as perfect as I can. It's as close to a digital
    scavenger hunt as you can get but still not even close to as amazing as the things you've done for me.

    And I'll be here for you
    Oh I will carry you over
    Fire and water for your love
    And I will hold you closer
    Hope your heart is strong enough
    When the night is coming down on you
    We will find a way through the dark
    I wish that I could take you to the stars
    I'd never let you fall and break your heart
    And if you wanna cry or fall apart
    I'll be there to hold you

    K. So, I'm just gonna start off by saying that you are my happy place. I'm always thinking about you. All the time. No matter what I'm
    doing. At work, Lauren. At school, Lauren. Listening to music, Lauren. Sleeping, Lauren. You always find a way to get into my head, and 
    it makes me so happy. Cause thinking about you makes me happy. Being with you makes me even happier. It makes me happier than I am when I listen to good music and thats saying a lot.  It's been proven that we can literally
    do anything and still have fun, even if I feel bad about dragging you around sometimes. It means crazy much to me that you can put up with my 
    crazy planning that never works, and my lack of ideas. Hopefully this app will help me out. Whoop.

      If we're caught in a wave
      I will carry you over
      It don't matter where you are
      I'll run to your front door

      When my head goes
      in different directions
      You know my heart's never on the move
      And in the dark times
      you don't have to question
      If I'm 100 with you

      You could put an ocean between
      our love, love, love
      It won't keep us apart
      You could build a wall,
      I would run it up, up, up
      Just to get to your heart
      If we're caught in a wave
      Baby, we'll make a way

    Putting songs in here is cute. I'm choosing these because I find them meaningful and accurate to how I feel. If we were caught in a wave, I would carry you over.
    Yeah yeah, it's in the lyrics, but its true. I would. I want to be with you and make you laugh and smile, and I would do so much for you. You mean the world to me.

      You so fuckin' precious when you smile
      Hit it from the back and drive you wild
      Girl, I lose myself up in those eyes
      I just had to let you know you're mine

      Hands on your body,
      I don't wanna waste no time
      Feels like forever even
      if forever's tonight
      Just lay with me,
      waste this night away with me
      You're mine, I can't look away,
      I just gotta say

      I'm so fucking happy you're alive
  </pre>

    You're the most beautiful and cute and happy and humble and intelligent and funny person I know. And, you so, fucking, precious, when you, smile.
    You're cute little smile could light up a room, and it makes me smile when you smile, then we are all smiling and happiness just comes in waves.

    WAIT, HOLD UP. Thats a depressing song. Well, the last sentence was just such a good segway into that. How witty.... And it's a pretty good song too.

    Im glad you chose me. I'm glad that I am yours, and that you are mine. I love calling you mine and spending time with you, and creating things for you
    and talking to you, and sitting in silence with you, and grocery shopping with you and so much more. I want to show you how much I love you. I want you to tell me if something is wrong
    so that I can fix it, and help you. I want you to know that I will tell you if I think that something is wrong or if I am unhappy about something.
    I am sharing myself, my time, my effort, and my heart, with you.

      If your ghost pulls you up high
      And it feels like you've lost who you are
      My love, there's no need to hide
      Just let me love you when your heart is tired
      Just let me love you
      Just let me love you
      Just let me love you
      Just let me love you when your heart is tired

    the fucking best lets be honest here. ANNYYYWHEEAYY..... The first words you ever text me were "Do u think culvers fries are too potatoey",
    and that was the beginning. I cant wait to see where the future takes us. So here is my app, enjoy it, enjoy me.
